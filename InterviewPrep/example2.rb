# Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

# Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in the alphabet:
# a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

# You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

# If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

# All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

p alphabet_score('man i need a taxi up to ubud') == 'taxi'
p alphabet_score('what time are we climbing up the volcano') == 'volcano'
p alphabet_score('take me to semynak') == 'semynak'
p alphabet_score('aa b') == 'aa'

# You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in expanded form. For example:
#
# expanded_form(12); # Should return '10 + 2'
# expanded_form(42); # Should return '40 + 2'
# expanded_form(70304); # Should return '70000 + 300 + 4'
#
# Note: All numbers will be whole numbers greater than 0.

p expanded_form(12) == '10 + 2'
p expanded_form(42) == '40 + 2'
p expanded_form(70304) == '70000 + 300 + 4'
